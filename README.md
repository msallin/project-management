# Project Management Toolkit

As a software architect, I often face the challenge of parallel projects that need alignment. 
For this, I require multiple representations of the same tasks — each tailored to different stakeholders. 
Since tasks inherently form a graph, I wanted a unified in-memory model that I can build programmatically or via Markdown. 
Then, I needed to generate various artifacts from that model. Generation is done using a visitor pattern so that it remains extensible.
So that I can create specialized visitors later for specific stakeholder needs or contexts.

A .NET-based project-planning library and console application that lets you:

- **Model** tasks as a hybrid WBS + directed-acyclic graph (DAG) with dependencies, descriptions and tags in code  
- **Import** your work-breakdown structure (WBS) from Markdown files  
- **Export** to multiple formats (Markdown tables, PlantUML WBS & Gantt, GraphViz DOT, Mermaid, PlantUML dependency diagrams)  
- **Analyze** critical paths  

---

## Features

- **Flexible WBS import**  
  - Heading levels (`#` → root, `##` → children, …) become task hierarchy  
  - Hierarchical IDs auto-generated (`1`, `1.1`, `1.1.1`, …) or picked up from numeric prefixes  
  - Multiline task descriptions from paragraphs under headings

- **Inline markers**  
  - `@(X.Y…)` in text → dependency on task with ID `X.Y…`  (e.g., `@(1.1.1)`))
  - `#tagName` anywhere in text → adds a tag to the current task (e.g., `#critical`, `#feasibility`)  
  - `#color:blue` → sets task color on export (e.g., `#color:red` for critical tasks)

- **Unified in-memory model**  
  - `TaskNode` objects hold `Id`, `Name`, `Description`, `Tags`, `Children` (WBS), `Dependencies` (DAG)  
  - `ProjectGraph` manages tasks, parent-child hierarchy, dependency cycle-checks, topological sort  

- **Visitor-based exporters**  
  - **`MarkdownTableVisitor`** → plain Markdown task table  
  - **`MindMapVisitor`** → `@startmindmap` tasks by tag Mindmap diagram
  - **`PlantUmlWbsVisitor`** → `@startwbs`…`@endwbs` WBS diagram  
  - **`PlantUmlGanttVisitor`** → `@startgantt`… Gantt chart  
  - **`DotVisitor`** → GraphViz `.dot` directed graph  
  - **`MermaidVisitor`** → `graph TD` for Mermaid.js  
  - **`PlantUmlDependencyVisitor`** → `@startuml`… dependency diagram  
  - **`CriticalPathVisitor`** → runs CP analysis and emits a Markdown report  

- **Analysis**  
  - **Critical-path analysis**: earliest/latest starts and finishes, slack, zero-slack path
